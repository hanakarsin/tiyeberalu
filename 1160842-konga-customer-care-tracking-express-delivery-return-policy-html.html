Here are the steps that you need to follow in order to buy something on Konga.com.</p><li>First of all, you should type the description of your desired good in the little search box that you can see on the website. If you are searching for something that fits into the specific category, you are supposed to search for goods by category on top of the Konga webpage.</li><li>Then, you can review the product by checking the client feedback on it, seeing how much of it has already been successfully sold and making sure that the delivery time is alright with you.</li><li>You should also review the person who sells the goods, and see how many successful sales and positive comments this seller has.</li><li>Create a Konga account (or sign up, if you already have one). New Konga customers are supposed to fill in the delivery form. Your goods will be delivered to this address. You can change it anytime.</li><li>Choose the method of payment that you prefer. Then click on the confirmation button.</li><li>Congratulations, you have completed the order!</li><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/70362d13b8133603.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazon my reviews section: discover how to find, edit and delete your feedback</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/e763036012b6bab0.jpeg><h2>Konga express delivery</h2><p class=align-left>Most of the Konga.com deliveries are processed through the KOS Delivery Courier. Some of the featured sellers have an opportunity of choosing other couriers for their deliveries or doing this on their own. The standard time for Konga delivery is 7 days – though, it varies depending mostly on the location, sometimes even on the product that is being shipped. Usually, the approximate delivery times are indicated for the customers on the product’s details page. The delivery is available only within Nigeria, as Konga does not ship their products internationally. You can find the final price for the product on the details page – all the taxes are included in the price, and you will not have to pay any more money upon delivery.</p><p class=align-left>Express delivery is possible for some locations. If you live there, you will most definitely get the product the same day you order it or the next day. The locations for the same day delivery service are Agege/Ijaiye, Apapa, Eti Osa, Ifako Ijaiye, Lagos Island, Lagos Mainland, Mushin, Oshodi/Isolo, Ikeja, Kosofe, Shomolu, and Surulere.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/36e28c20a6aac75f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover the usefulness of the UNN portal!</span></p></a><h2>Konga tracking</h2><p class=align-left>You can easily track your delivery package on the website track.konga.com. It is really easy to use – you are supposed just to enter your order or parcel number into the special field, then click “track”, and you will be shown what stage your delivery is right. This will help you to get a better understanding of the location of your parcel, and the time when it arrives at your place. By the way, the Konga tracking supports all the couriers.</p><h2>Konga return policy</h2><p class=align-left>Sometimes it happens that you do not like the good that was delivered to you for some reason. For example, the piece of clothing does not fit. In this case, you can return the good to Konga, but the return window is 7 days after the product has been delivered. To return the product to Konga, you will need to follow the next instructions:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt5cpdqg7riss.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to sell on Jumia?
