In 2016, it was estimated that he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">receiving a salary</a> of about €8.9 million. However, at the end of his career, Arsene Wenger salary from the club was $10 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a3d6262207cce3e9.jpg><p class=align-left>His long career and early successes both as an active player, coach, and club manager earned him an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">overall net worth</a> of $48 million.</p><h2>Arsene Wenger wife</h2><p class=align-left>Arsene had a long-time relationship with former French Olympic basketball player, Annie Brosterhous. The two began their relationship in the mid-90s but only got married in 2010. For the more significant part of their relationship, the couple <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">lived separately</a> due to Wenger's job. Annie lived in Monaco while he was in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d435e1a4d945333e.jpg><p class=align-left>Apart from the long-distance, their relationship was racked with other problems as well. Once in 2008, the football manager said that he does not get enough time to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">spend with his family</a>. He claimed that his intense dedication to his work and the amount of travel required for the same put a limit on his family time.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/04d26787d1f94b7e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Stephen A Smith?

And he said that they won't be offering me a new deal and that I could leave. But at the time I was injured and it was difficult, because I wasn't fit and I wasn't playing, and not many teams wanted me injured. So I decided to stay and I got back into the team and they finally offered me a deal in January which was ready to sign, and then Arsene got sacked. It was strange, everyone was just shocked and Per Mertesacker, the captain, said a few words, and I think everyone was just in shock."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2955ec334ed5bc6e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top facts about professional WWE wrestler Aleister Black</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He continued,</p>"It was strange.

According to the publication, the club’s accounts showed that Arsenal had paid him in full for at least that remaining year (as per the Arsene Wenger contract), with other settlements going to support staff who left at the same time.</p><h2>Who is Arsene Wenger replacement?</h2><p class=align-left>Spanish manager <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Unai Emery replaced</a> Arsene Wenger at Arsenal.

We all know there is a lot of work to be done to achieve that but I am confident we’ll do it. I’m realistic enough to know it won’t happen overnight but the current squad has plenty of talent and there is a great pipeline of young players coming through from the academy.”<p class=align-left>Josh Kroenke, speaking on behalf of the Arsenal board and our owners Kroenke Sports & Entertainment, said:</p>“We’re delighted to be bringing Mikel back to Arsenal. He knows our expectations and those of our fans around the world are high and we are confident he can play a lead role in taking the club back to the levels we all demand.
