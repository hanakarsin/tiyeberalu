Although Charlie didn't often sing leads in the group, he was responsible for lead vocals on songs like "When My Little Girl Is Smiling" and "I Don't Want to Go on Without You."</p><p>The band formally broke up in the late 1960s, although several members of the group continued to record and tour under the name. Charlie eventually started his only splinter version of the group, known as Charlie Thomas's Drifters, which toured as a group until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced them to stop. Charlie was among the members of the Drifters who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, along with six others who were in the group from 1953 to the late 1960s.</p><p>Charlie became a member of the group by accident. He was performing as a member of the Crowns, who were touring with the Drifters. When every member of the Drifters was fired, they were replaced by members of the Crowns.</p><p>Charlie is survived by his wife Rita as well as his daughters Crystal Thomas Wilson and Victoria Green and his sons Charlie Jr., Michael Sidbury, and Brian Godfrey. He also has many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWivsuinGasmKS6or%2BMnaminqSav7R5wpqsrJ1dpLNusMSaq6E%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcharlie-thomas-drifters-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcharlie-thomas-drifters-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcharlie-thomas-drifters-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcharlie-thomas-drifters-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcharlie-thomas-drifters-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcharlie-thomas-drifters-cause-of-death.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leah-messer-daughter-titin-muscular-dystrophy.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leah-messer-daughter-titin-muscular-dystrophy.html>Teen Mom 2 Star Leah Messer Addresses Daughter Alis Health Journey in New Memoir</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./barack-obama-html.html>Barack Obama (US President) - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./barack-obama-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
