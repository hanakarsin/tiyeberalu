Obviously, the rule of thumb is, don't try this at home (or on your home), but its hosts make things seem so easy. Not only are <a href=#>Mina Starsiak Hawk</a> and her mother <a href=#>Karen E. Laine</a> incredibly talented, but as a mother-daughter duo, it's very sweet to watch them work together.</p><p>In fact, until Karen recently retired, they both ran 2 Chicks and a Hammer, which is the company that does all the work on Good Bones. Karen now has more time to spend with her husband, but what about her daughter? Is Mina from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Bones</a> married and does she ever rest? She spoke exclusively with Distractify about the perks — and challenges — of living life in the public eye while also balancing her private life with her husband and <a href=#>kids</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@mina_starsiak_hawk</a><p>Mina Starsiak Hawk and her husband</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Mina from 'Good Bones' married? Meet Mina's husband.</h2><p>Mina from Good Bones is using her good judgment and good sense to build herself a good life with her <a href=#>husband, Steve Hawk</a>. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Living</a>, the couple met via "mutual friends on Facebook" in 2013. Mina said she thought Steve was cute, but Karen stepped in with a different version of events. Evidently Mina thought Steve was "stunningly handsome."</p><p>Their first date was less than ideal, with Steve ignoring Mina all night while his friends spent the evening flirting with her. Luckily for Steve, Mina was willing to give him another chance. After exchanging numbers, she texted, "We're going to try this again tomorrow — you get one more shot."</p><p>As much as we want to say the rest was smooth sailing, they briefly broke up when Steve was behaving "really badly — in a phenomenally bad way," Karen told Country Living.</p><p>But then in March 2015, Steve and Mina got engaged, with Mina showing off an absolutely stunning ring <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">via an Instagram post</a>. A little over a year later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mina and Steve were married</a> and it wasn't long before they had <a href=#>two children</a>, Jack in August 2018 followed by Charlotte in March 2020.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@mina_starsiak_hawk</span><p>Mina's engagement ring and her wedding photo with Steve</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mina's husband, Steve Hawk, is a personal trainer.</h2><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Steve's Instagram bio</a>, he's the owner of HawkFit personal training. On the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">company's website</a>, Steve reveals that his love of fitness was activated when he noticed his metabolism slowing down at the ripe old age of 28. From that moment on he vowed to take better care of both his body and his mind. He became a certified personal trainer and nutritionist, promising to help others the way he helps himself.</p><p>But you don't have to live near Steve to reap the benefits of Steve's personal training. His programs are available on the TrueCoach app where he has "different programs based on your goals that we discuss together." He can also tailor specific workouts to fit your needs. With each program, you will receive "customized daily workouts, nutritional and supplemental guidance, unlimited direct in-app messaging with Coach Hawk, a community of support to help you achieve your goals, and much more!"</p><p>Sounds like Steve also knows how to help people get good bones! What a team he and Mina make.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mina Starsiak Hawk (@mina_starsiak_hawk)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Steve and Mina have slightly different opinions about being approached in public by fans.</h2><p>Most of us are lucky enough to do our grocery shopping in obscurity, but when you're as beloved and recognizable as Mina, being recognized in public kind of comes with the territory. Mina spoke a bit about being approached by people when she's out and about.</p><p>Usually, she's more than happy to engage with her fans. "I kind of look at it as the only reason we have the show and it is so successful is because we have an awesome fanbase," she said. "People really do feel like they know us, so we're approachable, and I never mind."</p><p>Steve, on the other hand, may sometimes wish for a bit more privacy. "I think my husband probably wishes I had more [boundaries] and would set more because ... whatever is happening, [I feel] is fine, where he has a much more reasonable [perspective]," Mina said. "Like sometimes, it's not opportune, and people can't really read the room."</p><p>Luckily, Mina's fans can rest assured that they can always get their fix by watching Good Bones (or other HGTV shows like <a href=#>Rock the Block</a> and Good Bones: Risky Business.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuucinmGaeoqS6brPOqJtmmp%2BjsrR5zJqpq6GVmQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-mina-from-good-bones-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-mina-from-good-bones-married.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-mina-from-good-bones-married.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-mina-from-good-bones-married.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-mina-from-good-bones-married.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-mina-from-good-bones-married.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-did-trump-say-about-ghislaine-maxwell.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-did-trump-say-about-ghislaine-maxwell.html>What Did Trump Say About Ghislaine Maxwell?
