The movie follows an American woman named Lindsey who is trying to open a resort in <a href=#>I</a>reland. But the locals aren't convinced that an outsider like Lindsey should do it, or that it's good for their community. Lindsey decides to prove her commitment (and win over a cute Irish guy named Brennan) by joining the annual matchmaking festival.</p><p>If you're not gonna watch for the sweet story (and JoAnna Garcia Swisher and Allen Leech's great performance), then you should at least watch for the sights. As Luck Would Have It is set in Ireland ... but is it actually filmed there?</p><figure class="sc-bkbjAj gDLPQT"><span>Source: The Hallmark Channel</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where was 'As Luck Would Have It' filmed?</h2><p>Although a lot of Hallmark movies are filmed in Canada (it's generally cheaper), As Luck Would Have It is, indeed, filmed in Ireland. It seems to have been filmed in several locations, which includes Waterford, Ireland. This is where Lismore Castle (Caisleán an Leasa Mhóir) is located — it's one of the places Lindsey and Brennan go to, and it's the place that Lindsey wants to turn into a resort. Other locations include the Cliffs of Moher and Howth Castle.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Hallmark Channel/YouTube</span></figure><p>Allen was interviewed by the Hallmark Channel and chatted a little bit about how Ireland was such a great location for the film, given the story. Lindsey comes from New York and she's extremely tense because of her high-pressure job. Ireland allows her to relax a little bit and really enjoy the beauty surrounding her. One of those beautiful locations is the Cliffs of Moher, which is one of Allen's favorite places.</p><p>The Cliff of Moher is a major tourist attraction that overlooks the Clare coast (FYI, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and The Princess Bride was also filmed here). Lindsey admitted that the Cliffs had a "cold, piercing wind." Indeed, it was pretty cold when As Luck Would Have It was filmed. Allen shared that the production team “[made] it look like the height of summer. I can promise you it wasn’t as we filmed.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The Hallmark Channel</span></figure><p>Another location was the Howth Castle, which, interestingly enough, is being purchased by an American company in order to be turned into the hotel (which is the exact same premise as the movie). “I hope that they will, like in the story, maintain a lot of its features,” Allen says.</p><p>JoAnna agreed with Allen in that Ireland is the perfect location for a romance movie. “I think Ireland is the perfect setting for any love story. It is so beautiful … the backdrop is miraculous.”&nbsp;She added, “Everything is steeped in tradition and history. It’s really unique and beautiful.”</p><p>And apparently Allen was a great tour guide: “It’s really nice to get to come over and share his country with him. He’s been a great tour guide,” she said.</p><figure class="sc-bkbjAj gDLPQT"><span>Source: The Hallmark Channel</span></figure><p>Watch As Luck Would Have It tonight at 9 p.m. ET on the Hallmark Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWmvsRmrpqrXZbAbrjUnKJmr5%2BquaV5x5qtnmWZqXqntcumnJ0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-was-as-luck-would-have-it-filmed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-was-as-luck-would-have-it-filmed.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-was-as-luck-would-have-it-filmed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-was-as-luck-would-have-it-filmed.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-was-as-luck-would-have-it-filmed.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-was-as-luck-would-have-it-filmed.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./fraud-tinubu-boasted-suspended-efcc-chairman-magu-would-protect-him.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./fraud-tinubu-boasted-suspended-efcc-chairman-magu-would-protect-him.html>'Tinubu Boasted Suspended EFCC Chairman Magu Would Protect Him'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./living-in-poverty-is-really-expensive.html>It Costs a Lot of Money to Be Poor</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./living-in-poverty-is-really-expensive.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
