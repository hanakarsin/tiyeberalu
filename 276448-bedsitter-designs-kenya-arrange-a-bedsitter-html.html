Well, most Kenyans go for the curtain room dividers. You can also use shelves, gallery wall, or maybe cabinets to do the dividing of the room. If you go for the shelves, kindly arrange it properly with staffs that suit it such as books. Most go for the gallery wall because cardboards are available at a cheaper price in Kenya; your favorite pictures on the cardboard will also make your room glow.</p><h3>2. Use coloured light</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs66pdrhhqgg.jpeg><p class=align-left>The coloured lights will definitely create a beautiful ambiance in your bedsitter. That bright colour makes a room to pop making it to attract you and anyone who gives you a visit. Try it and you will fall in love with the illusions that the bright colours create in your small palace.</p><p class=align-left>The beautiful thing about lighting a room with the colored lights is that they are very powerful. You can purchase the color changing bulbs that will give you a dozen of color shades to light up your bedsitter. The bulbs are available in different formats and creativity, the more cheaper the color-changing LED bulb is, the more it has limited colors to choose from. You can also purchase one colored LED bulb that has your color palette to save on your cash.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/35c894dece4c237f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest wooden bed designs in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>During the day, it is best that you allow sunlight into the room. This means that you should avoid curtains that are too heavy because they are opaque and they will not brighten the room. You can go for the sheer curtains and experience how they lit up the room’s mood. Yes, the heavy curtains create a beautiful style in a room, but they block off the light in your bedsitter making them not to be a good choice for a one-room unit.</p><h3>3. Choice of furniture</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8666a65131911b69.jpeg><p class=align-left>How to arrange a small bedsitter will be simple if you consider the type of furniture you purchase. A bedsitter is probably a room that can best accommodate one person. Therefore, there is no harm if you go for the multi –purpose furniture especially if your bedsitter has a limited space. Cluttering the room with loads of furniture will makes it look awful. For instance, you can mount shelves on the room’s wall or go for the under-bed drawers. You can also purchase a table or seat with drawers.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/17ca8ba16ef5fb04.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The best suit styles for men that are a sure bet even this year</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The good bit about this multi-purpose furniture is that they will occupy the same floor area thus giving you more storage space. Some even prefer to go for a sofa bed and their bedsitters look fabulous. It is very vital for you to always pay attention to the size of furniture before you purchase it. The main reason to that is to avoid it being either too small or large. If you have unnecessary furniture, you can sell them or give them to charity so that your room cannot have that cluttered look.</p><h3>4. Try as much as possible to create illusions</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs4pr5t2f6ts.jpeg><p class=align-left>What most people do, they use mirrors to create illusions about the size of the room. A mirror will make your room appear more bigger.</p><p class=align-left>Some even go to an extent of going for furniture with high legs. This is because the exposed floor area create illusions that a room is much bigger than it actually is. The low piece of furniture will always make a room appear crowded and this is where many Kenyans go wrong. Another solution to create illusions is to go for glass as well as metallic furniture such as a table.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs2en1gvu9hhkg.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Looking forward to build a dream house in Kenya?
