So, the PDP has prospects in the state, which is why it has to do what is necessary to get the maximum possible from the state,” Secondus said.</p><p>“The 2019 governorship election results, which were a combination of the March 9 election and the March 23 rerun, showed the APC polled 1,033,695 votes, while the PDP scored 1,024,713 votes. With the above analysis, you will see that the PDP will need the cooperation of the two gentlemen to remain popular and win these states.”</p><p>The former PDP chairman described Peter Obi and Kwankwaso&nbsp;as “valuable persons” to the party.</p><p>Also speaking, the Chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, Senator Walid Jibrin, pointed out that Peter Obi could split the South-East votes into three.</p><p>He stated that the PDP must work to stop the splitting of votes in the southeast as that used to be its stronghold.</p><p>“We may have a situation whereby Obi will have some votes from there (South-East), then our party and the APC will get votes as well. We need to work against that. The South-East is our zone and we know the people and the voters there will not abandon us,” he stated.</p><p>A source privy to the planned discussions between Atiku, Obi and Kwankwaso said, “We will talk to them. The battle ahead is not personal. We need to win the election and rescue the country from the bad governance of the ruling party. Thank God that we have about nine months ahead of us before the conduct of the general elections.</p><p>“We have enough time to engage people and solidify whatever agreement we want to propose. We should not allow this opportunity to slip from our hands.”</p><h3>Everyone matters – Atiku’s aide</h3><p>Speaking to The PUNCH, Paul Ibe, an aide to Atiku Abubakar, said when contesting against a ruling party everyone matters.</p><p>He stated that Atiku has been consulting with everyone since he grabbed the ticket of the PDP.</p><p>He added, “After he won the primary, he met with other aspirants, PDP governors, former ministers and other stakeholders. In this race, especially when you are contesting against a ruling party, everyone matters. These are extraordinary times and they require extraordinary measures.</p><p>“So, there will be alliances and the objective is to kick out the APC that has done nothing than to make Nigerians suffer, promote division and entrench a state of insecurity. But I can’t say if the party is reaching out to them (Obi and Kwankwaso).”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH13e5BqZq2hnqqvtnnAraCkrV2pvG65xJ6rZqiVqbKzec6boGajp5a7rMPArKZmmaNivaW8jKaspaSjYrCwuMuamaiqkam2sLqMmp6aoZ6owW6tz5xm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftinubu-atiku-to-meet-peter-obi-kwankwaso-as-pdp-mulls-collaboration-against-apc.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftinubu-atiku-to-meet-peter-obi-kwankwaso-as-pdp-mulls-collaboration-against-apc.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftinubu-atiku-to-meet-peter-obi-kwankwaso-as-pdp-mulls-collaboration-against-apc.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftinubu-atiku-to-meet-peter-obi-kwankwaso-as-pdp-mulls-collaboration-against-apc.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftinubu-atiku-to-meet-peter-obi-kwankwaso-as-pdp-mulls-collaboration-against-apc.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftinubu-atiku-to-meet-peter-obi-kwankwaso-as-pdp-mulls-collaboration-against-apc.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./beverly-hills-90210-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./beverly-hills-90210-html.html>Beverly Hills, 90210 - Cast, Ages, Trivia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ive-caused-a-lot-of-people-pain-burna-boy-laments.html>'I've Caused A Lot Of People Pain'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ive-caused-a-lot-of-people-pain-burna-boy-laments.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
