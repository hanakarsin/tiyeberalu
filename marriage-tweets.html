Sure, Ariel and Prince Eric got married and the wedding was beautiful, but if we were to cut to a year later, we'd see Ariel screaming at Eric from the bathroom to bring her toilet paper because he didn't replace it the last time he used it. These 20 tweets will be too real (and funny!) for anyone who really knows what married life is like.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">1.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This is very true. Going to a furniture store without your own tape measure or measurements of your home beforehand is amateur hour. If you're married or have been in a long-term relationship with someone you live with, you know the right way to shop for furniture. It's to descend on IKEA with eagle-like precision.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">2.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>The thing about most dudes is that use toilet paper less than half the time they use the bathroom. They may not realize just how life-altering bad toilet paper can be for a person. There are many things it's OK to skimp on in life. Toilet paper is not one of them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">3.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This is the story of my life! If your husband is worth staying married to, he will give you the grilled cheese he just made and then go make himself another. At the very least, he should make you one after he finishes his.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">4.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This is love. One of my favorite activities is popping my partner's pimples. True intimacy isn't always about sexy stuff. Sometime it's about grooming. Monkeys do this, and so do humans who are in love.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">5.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Here's the thing, though. Once it's folded, you don't mess with it. There's nothing romantic about ruining half an hour of work. This would totally ruin the mood. Sexy times should be reserved for when the laundry is done and put away.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">6.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I don't understand why this is true, but it 100 percent is. Maybe the sneezes get louder. Maybe you're starting to get more sensitive to noises. Whatever the reason, this is the realest statement I have ever read.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">7.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I can confirm that this happens even before you're married. When my fiancé swears we did something or went somewhere that I have no memory of, I say he must have done that with his other girlfriend, "Bobin."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">8.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This is so real, though. If I buy a snack I know my fiancé will like, I have to hide it from him so I can get one bite before he finishes it off in a single session. There have been so many times where I'm like, "Where are the chips I bought yesterday?!" and he's like, "...oops."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">9.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This goes both ways, too. Often, I hear myself responding with "Uh huhs" or "Rights" when my partner is talking, and then I realize I'm not listening at all and I have to play catch up. He does the same with me though, so we're even.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">10.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>Luckily, my partner and I are probably in bed by 10:20 every night, but we still have this problem. Usually, it's like, 9:30 and he turns to me and asks, "One more episode?" and I am already passed out on the couch, drooling on a pillow.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">11.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>The longer you're with the person, the more easily you are able to identify the sources of their breath and belches and other bodily functions. "That's a chicken wing burp!" I'll say, or, "Ooh, I know a dairy fart when I hear one."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">12.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>"But the green would go with the curtains and wouldn't clash with the carpet! What are you thinking?!" It's amazing how much of your adult life becomes seriously arguing about things you would have been ashamed to have an opinion on ten years earlier.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">13.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This is such a dramatic whirlwind of a story. I feel for this couple. He messed up by putting the popcorn maker in the oven, where it's probably never been before. She messed up by preheating the oven without checking to make sure nothing was in the oven because they don't ever store anything in there. And now their oven is ruined, as are their conversations for the next month.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">14.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>As your partner, I expect you to know every detail about how my body is feeling at every moment of the day, including during sex, and I expect the same information from you. This is what true love entails, people!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">15.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>When you are married to someone, that means they have publicly declared their love for you. It is your responsibility not to look like a total doofus, which in turn would make the partner who chose to be with you look dumb as well.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">16.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>What a sneaky trick! I would be so mad if I found out my partner was doing this to me, but also this is 100 percent something I would and will do to my partner the next chance I get. So I don't know what to tell you. I'm a monster.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">17.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>If you are in a relationship with someone or even just good friends with someone, it is your obligation to discreetly and politely tell them when they have something in their teeth. Signed, someone who always has something stuck in her teeth</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">18.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I'm sorry. You may love your partner more than any other human being in the world. But dog love? It's unconditional. A dog will never be mean to you or avoid doing the dishes or forget to buy you chocolate on their way home from work.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">19.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>I don't know, but keep your damn hands to yourself! I grew up with a brother so I always had to watch my food like a hawk, and I thought that would be over forever when I moved out, but then, like an idiot, I chose to move in with another grown man, who's basically a vulture for whatever I'm eating at all times.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">20.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><p>This is exactly how it goes in my house, too! It really helps that my fiancé isn't a huge fan of chocolate, which at first I thought was a character flaw, but then I realized all it means is my stash is safe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6zvsianp5lpKyypsDS</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarriage-tweets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmarriage-tweets.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmarriage-tweets.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmarriage-tweets.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarriage-tweets.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarriage-tweets.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hushpuppi-best-wishes-to-people-waiting-to-see-us-arrested-abba-kyari.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hushpuppi-best-wishes-to-people-waiting-to-see-us-arrested-abba-kyari.html>Hushpuppi: Best Wishes To People Waiting To See Us Arrested</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./giant-burrito-dispenser.html>The Burrito Pop Promises the Best Burrito Eating Experience Ever</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./giant-burrito-dispenser.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
