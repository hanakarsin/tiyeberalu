He is the first son. He should be in charge.”</p><p>Wayas jr told the platform that the funeral committee was saddled with the task of handling the funeral and that he had little to do.</p><p>He commended Ayade for the support he gave to the committee but said 14 months after, they were unable to bury his father.</p><p>Wayas Jr added, “The funeral is not exactly in our hands but that of the funeral committee. I heard there are issues surrounding the funeral funds. And some members are said to have resigned. I cannot go back to the state governor or federal government now due to election issues. The governor has done well already.”</p><p>In an earlier interview, Wayas jr regretted the delay in carrying out the burial of his father but appealed that the body is given its last respect soon.</p><p>Wayas Jr thanked President Muhamudu Buhari, who had facilitated his father’s trip to London when he first took ill.</p><p>He said his father had access to the best medical care, but the resources he gave got exhausted within three months.</p><p>According to him, before the senior Wayas died, it was his sister in London who bore the cost of his treatment and had been maintaining the corpse since 2021.</p><p>Commenting, the permanent secretary of the state Ministry of Health, Dr Iwara Iwara, said, “As it is well known, the state governor empanelled a committee. As a person, I haven’t heard anything further. I cannot be able to give reasons why the burial is delayed.”</p><p>Chief media adviser to the governor, Barrister Christian Ita, said, “I don’t want to get involved in the matter. Perhaps the first son is the problem. But speak to members of the funeral committee. The governor actually released money for the burial months ago.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5BqZp%2BnoqKys3nSnqWarJVivbOx0qKbnqakqHqku9Gpqp5lkZeur7DOp5ydZZmjeq27zZ2mp2Wfq7KzecWupZ2rXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fformer-senate-presidents-corpse-abandoned-in-london-over-funds.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fformer-senate-presidents-corpse-abandoned-in-london-over-funds.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fformer-senate-presidents-corpse-abandoned-in-london-over-funds.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fformer-senate-presidents-corpse-abandoned-in-london-over-funds.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fformer-senate-presidents-corpse-abandoned-in-london-over-funds.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fformer-senate-presidents-corpse-abandoned-in-london-over-funds.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leave-packages-outside-fence-dogs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leave-packages-outside-fence-dogs.html>Amazon Customer Asks Driver to Leave Package Outside Fence and Quickly Learned Why</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./woman-doing-dishes-saran-wrap-hack.html>TikTok Loves This Woman's Hack to Avoid Washing Dishes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./woman-doing-dishes-saran-wrap-hack.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
