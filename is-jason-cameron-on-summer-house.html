While she noted that Jason had been incredibly supportive and "absolutely wonderful" as the two grieved their loss during that time, it did ultimately put a strain on their relationship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Though Lindsay and Jason were at a crossroads in their romance when filming began, the latter reality star's name has already been a big part of Summer House Season 6. Will he be appearing on the show at any point?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Jason Cameron appearing on 'Summer House' Season 6?</h2><p>The model is not an official castmate for Summer House Season 6, but his name was mentioned several times in the Season 6 premiere ("Where's My Lover, Boy?"). At the first group dinner, Lindsay confirmed that Jason was supposed to be at the house during the first weekend in the Hamptons.</p><p>"I told him not to come," Lindsay told her co-star, Paige DeSorbo. Later on in the episode, Lindsay opened up to Carl Radke about her pregnancy loss, and how that led to a shift in their burgeoning romance.</p><p>It's unclear at this time if Jason will be visiting the house at any point in Season 6 as a guest. While Jason was not part of the trailer for the season, he could be making a weekend appearance at some point in the future to hash out his relationship with Lindsay.</p><p>According to his Instagram feed, Jason did spend time in the Hamptons in late June 2021, which is around the time when filming for Season 6 commenced.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jason Cameron (@jasoncameron13)</a></p></figure><p>If Jason does appear on Summer House, he won't be the only Winter House newbie to trade in his snowsuit for a bathing suit. Andrea Denver is an official full-time cast member on Season 6.</p><p>Southern Charm stars Craig Conover and Austen Kroll, who also starred on Winter House, will be making guest appearances on Summer House as well.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Lindsay and Jason are no longer together, and the 'Summer House' star is currently dating Carl Radke.</h2><p>Though Jason and Lindsay had an undeniable spark in Vermont, and they were able to navigate their romance off-camera for a few months, the two are no longer dating.</p><p>The Hubb House PR founder was never official with the model/non-profit worker. Lindsay is currently in a relationship with Carl Radke.</p><p>Carl and Lindsay had explored the possibility of dating in Season 4 of Summer House, but they ultimately chose not to risk their friendship. While they both went on to date other people, things shifted in the summer of 2021.</p><p>"We're definitely dating!" Lindsay said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six </a>while promoting the show in January 2022.</p><p>While Lindsay said that they had yet to put a label on their relationship, Carl later confirmed that the two were "girlfriend-boyfriend" during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Lindsay is now happily in a relationship with someone else, and Jason has yet to share whether he is dating anyone else.</p><p>Summer House airs on Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.
