His path took a unique turn when he joined the family business and took over the position of Marketing Manager at Gongoni Company Limited. Gongoni is a vertically integrated aerosol manufacturing company and forms part of the sister company, Scirrocco International Limited, which specializes in the manufacturing of tea and cold beverages.</p><p>Halilu also served as Chief Operating Officer at Scirrocco and held this position for a little over three consecutive years.</p><p>At the young age of only 23, he already held several positions in various companies as well as established an outstanding reputation for himself in the business sector.</p><p>Some positions Khalil has held over the time frame of three years include:</p><p>– Managing Director (MD) at Khash Strategic Services Ltd. In 2014.</p><p>– KSH Construction & Design LTD in 2014 Creative Director/Business developer- Africa Infotech Consultancy–2015 Operations Manager at ZCET Global Meter Services Ltd. in 2017</p><p>A CHANGE OF HEART AND DIRECTION</p><p>After unsuccessfully enrolling into a JAVA and DBA course, Halilu adapted and switched lanes to reach his goals and dreams. He committed to carrying out in-depth research and stumbled upon the wonderful world of System Architecture along the line.</p><p>This type of architecture solely concentrates on design, construction, maintaining, and upgrading software and technological systems.</p><p>In 2018, KSH steered his focus onto this new field in the business world. He shepherded away from the sector his family’s businesses operate in and created something for himself in a completely distinct niche.</p><p>He subsequently focused on ways to provide sustainable solutions to technologically advanced environments. It was only after he altered course that Khalil came to the staggering realization that opportunities abound everywhere and It really depends on your point of view.</p><p>In the same year, OyaOya Strategic Services Ltd and ShapShap Logistics Ltd. came into being. OyaOya is a technological application designed to connect commodity traders in an ecosystem that is both fast and efficient.</p><p>ShapShap is an on-demand platform popular in Africa for catering to personal and business logistical needs. A technological application, ShapShap connects clients with drivers supported with flexible route options and insurance cover on goods being transported.</p><p>The app’s primary aim is to encourage SME growth and help bridge the gap between businesses and the unbanked people in Africa.</p><p>In 2018, Halilu also launched Zabe, an election monitoring application that monitors election counts in Nigeria and provides detailed feedback on the election process to observers.</p><p>In 2019, he founded the first-ever eco-friendly technological hub in West Africa, best known as The CANs. The hub grew very popular over a short period and has continued to attract fellow environmentalists and technology enthusiasts from all over the continent. A community that encourages individuals to share ideas, host events, and become one with nature, The CANS is not only a technological platform but serves as a center, where technology start-ups can connect, learn, grow and prosper.</p><p>He also played an integral role in the setup of New AD, a UK-based company that is developing and supporting the global anaerobic digestion industry and other important technology inventions and devices used in the renewable energy enterprise.</p><p>AWARDS</p><p>Away from his tertiary education, he had got various awards and certificates for his participation and contribution to the growth and sustainability of the advancement of technology in Africa.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e49qZpqknGLGsMGMp5yenF2pvG63zaiuZpmSpMK1ecqhmKWhnGLAtrjEoqSapl1of27FxJqpZqecmXqvrdKepaJlkqTAtHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-you-need-to-know-about-khalil-suleiman-32-year-old-naseni-boss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-you-need-to-know-about-khalil-suleiman-32-year-old-naseni-boss.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-you-need-to-know-about-khalil-suleiman-32-year-old-naseni-boss.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-you-need-to-know-about-khalil-suleiman-32-year-old-naseni-boss.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-you-need-to-know-about-khalil-suleiman-32-year-old-naseni-boss.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-you-need-to-know-about-khalil-suleiman-32-year-old-naseni-boss.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./apcs-ize-iyamu-reacts-after-losing-edo-governorship-election.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./apcs-ize-iyamu-reacts-after-losing-edo-governorship-election.html>APC's Ize-Iyamu Reacts After Losing Edo Governorship Election</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./55737-html.html>PHOTO: Chika Ike In Fabulous Sheikh Zayed Mosque, Abu Dhabi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./55737-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
