That's especially true for women, even when they don't appear to have done anything wrong.</p><p>Recently, a college student named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lily Lang</a> got caught up in an online smear campaign that eventually led her to set all of her online accounts to private. Here's what we know about who she is, and why she was suddenly at the center of so much online hate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Lily Lang?</h2><p>Lily Lang is a college student in the Southeastern Conference of Schools whose name started popping up all over the internet as part of the so-called "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Burnerverse</a>." This essentially describes a group of current and former fraternity members who banded together on Twitter to call out people they feel are worthy of shame. Lily was a particular target, and was accused of cheating on her boyfriend with multiple men from different colleges.</p><p>After these allegations started flying, Lily became the subject of numerous memes, and her name began to circulate around this online community. The posts started with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arthur Cacciatore</a>, a man who was in a frat in 2008 and began posting about Lily.</p><p>Lily's name and image began to circulate after his posts, with memes shaming her or comparing her to other women who have gone viral on on the internet.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Lily has also been described as the SEC girl.</h2><p>While many of the women who go viral on the internet at least take solace in the fact that their names were never revealed. Lily, who is also known as SEC girl, was not afforded that luxury. After facing this campaign of vitriol and harassment, she took all of her social media accounts private.</p><p>While it's possible that she was unfaithful to one of her romantic partners, this kind of mass pile-on still feels entirely unjustified.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Idk what this Lily Lang lore is about but it’s got the sec burner accounts riled up <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LicEkqFLeX</a></p>— 5’12” (@drunkest_rick) <a href=#>June 24, 2024</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@drunkest_rick</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is the Burnerverse?</h2><p>The Burnerverse, which is the corner of Twitter where Lily's name went viral, appears to be a collection of former fraternity members who have similar interests and maybe engage in a fair bit of misogyny. While it's not a formally organized group, these people all follow one another, and that means that the memes that they generate can circulate both within their community and outside of it.</p><p>Lily has become one of the most high-profile targets of this group, many of whom keep their accounts relatively anonymized. Like gamergate and other online phenomena that explicitly target women, these campaigns may seem like they are all in good fun, but they do lasting damage to the people who face them.</p><p>Lily Lang is still in college, and whatever her faults might be, she did not deserve the kind of harsh treatment that she has received in June of 2024. Hopefully, that attention will die down, and she will be able to find a way to continue living her life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKWhnK56ra3NoA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-lily-lang.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-lily-lang.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-lily-lang.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-lily-lang.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-lily-lang.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-lily-lang.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-hole-in-the-ground-netflix.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-hole-in-the-ground-netflix.html>'The Hole in the Ground' Might Be the Scariest Movie on Netflix</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./man-70-protesters-shelter-in-his-home.html>Man Lets 70 Protesters Shelter in His Home After Police Dispersed Them During Curfew</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./man-70-protesters-shelter-in-his-home.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
