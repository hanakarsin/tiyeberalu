While explaining that this requirement is to strengthen Customer Due Diligence (CDD) regulations and deepen the identification process in the banking system, CBN explained that the primary objective is to further the compliance of financial institutions under its regulatory purview with relevant provisions of the Money Laundering (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022, Terrorism (Prevention and Prohibition) Act, 2022, CBN (Anti-Money Laundering, Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Countering Proliferation Financing of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Financial Institutions) Regulations, 2022, and international best practices.</p><p>The new regulation, contained in Circular number FPR/DIR/PUB/CIR/007/076 dated June 20, 2023, stipulates as follows for individuals under the customer identification column: “legal name and any other names used (such as maiden name), permanent address (full physical address), residential address (where the customer can be located), telephone number, e-mail address, and social media handle; date and place of birth, Bank Verification Number, Tax Identification Number, nationality, occupation, public position held, and name of employer.” Isn’t it redundant and repetitious imposing these multiple requirements on the bank customer when two or three of them could suffice?</p><p>By this circular, banks and other financial institutions licensed by the CBN are now required to observe the CDD measures when establishing business relationships; and when carrying out occasional transactions above the applicable and designated threshold of $1,000 or it’s equivalent in other currencies or as may be determined by the CBN from time to time, including where the transaction is carried out in a single or several transactions or operations that appear to be linked. The measures are also required when carrying out occasional transactions that are wire transfers, including cross-border and domestic transfers between financial institutions, and when credit or debit cards are used as a payment method to effect money transfers.</p><p>The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has voiced its rejection of the Core Curriculum Minimum Academic Standards (CCMAS) set by the National Universities Commission (NUC).</p><p>The union warns that the standards are a threat to the quality of university education and erode the power of university Senates.</p><p>ASUU’s national president, Prof. Emmanuel Osodeke, in a statement on Friday, expressed concerns over NUC’s control of the majority of CCMAS contents, calling it a “nightmare”.</p><p>He explained that it was alarming that NUC had 70% influence over the CCMAS, leaving university Senates to work on just 30%.</p><p>The statement further highlighted the “numerous shortcomings and gross inadequacies” of the CCMAS documents, indicating growing apprehension within the academic community.</p><p>The Police Service Commission (PSC) has approved the appointment and deployment of eight new Commissioners of Police to State Commands across the nation.</p><p>Naija News reports that this was made known in a statement to newsmen on Friday.</p><p>The Commission commended the acting Inspector General of Police, Kayode Egbetokun for adhering to its latest Policy on gender sensitivity in his recommendation.</p><p>The Commission however urged the IGP to subsequently include more Officers of North East and South East geopolitical zones that are yet to record the benchmark of 15 percent as decided at its last Plenary Meeting .</p><p>The newly appointed State Commissioners of Police are; Godwin Aghaulor now CP Borno State Command; Adelesi E.
