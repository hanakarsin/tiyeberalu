Who is Shou Zi Chew's wife? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Shou Zi Chew's wife?</h2><p>Shou became the CEO of TikTok when the founder of its parent company stepped down in 2021. He is originally from Singapore, and he met his wife Vivian Kao in 2008 when they were both attending Harvard Business School. Vivian is Taiwanese American, and currently works in the financial sector. She is an independent, non-executive director at Sun Hung Kai & Co, a financial firm based out of Hong Kong.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Vivian also the CEO and principal of Tamarind Global, and serves on the board of Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She studied as an undergrad at the university, earning a degree in economics and Chinese studies before she moved over to Harvard for her MBA. She and her husband are undoubtedly very wealthy, but they have managed to stay mostly out of the public eye, at least until Shou's Congressional testimony.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does Shou Zi Chew have kids?</h2><p>In addition to this wife, Shou also has two young children who are 6 and 8 years old. Their names haven't been disclosed to the public, but it was recently reported by The Guardian that he and his wife don't let their children have access to TikTok yet. He was asked about those reports during his testimony, and explained that because he lives in Singapore, his situation is different than it would be in the U.S.</p><p>"I have seen these news articles. Let me address that," he said. "My kids live in Singapore and in Singapore, we do not have the under-13 experience. If they lived here in the United States, I would let them use the under-13 experience."</p><p>Shou was referring to a specific version of TikTok that's designed only for children under the age of 13, which filters out content that could be harmful to them.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Shou received a major grilling during his Congressional hearing.</h2><p>Shou faced pretty heated opposition from both Democrats and Republicans during his testimony on Capitol Hill. The main axis of concern was focused on the widespread belief that TikTok, which is owned by the Chinese corporation Bytedance, could become a tool of the Chinese government.</p><p>Shou went out of his way throughout his testimony to dispute this claim, stating that TikTok in the U.S. is staffed by American employees, and the data for the app is also being stored on American soil. Even so, conversations continue to be had on Capitol Hill about the possibility of banning the app, though it isn't clear exactly how that ban might be implemented and what the potential ramifications might be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWwwYyzoGabmJrEbsPIn5w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshou-zi-chew-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshou-zi-chew-wife.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshou-zi-chew-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshou-zi-chew-wife.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshou-zi-chew-wife.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshou-zi-chew-wife.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hollywood-hs-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hollywood-hs-html.html>Hollywood High School - Past And Present Attendees</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./423821-watu-wawili-waponea-baada-ya-ndege-walimokuwa-wakisafiria-kuanguka-html.html>Watu Wawili Waponea Baada ya Ndege Walimokuwa Wakisafiria Kuanguka</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./423821-watu-wawili-waponea-baada-ya-ndege-walimokuwa-wakisafiria-kuanguka-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
