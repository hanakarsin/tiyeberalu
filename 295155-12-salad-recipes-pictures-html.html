If you relate with this scenario, then that will not be the case anymore.</p><p class=align-left>Here are some tips on how to get it right</p><ul><li><strong>Prepare the dressing of the salad - </strong>Use fresh ingredients that would give the dressing that extra punch of flavor that would be difficult to get in a bottle. The standard ratio is three parts oil combined with one part of vinegar. However, you are free to skew it more if you would like your dressing to be slightly more acidic.</li><li><strong>Season the greens</strong> - One of the biggest secrets of achieving that exceptionally delicious salad is proper seasoning. You can also make a point of additionally seasoning the greens too.</li><li><strong>Include a variety </strong>- A good mixture of greens offers a varied flavor and texture, a tip that chefs use well to elevate their salads. Try this out on your cooking as well if you want to enjoy your homemade salad.</li><li><strong>Mix with fresh herbs</strong> - You can be extra adventurous and include an additional set of fresh herbs as this is the perfect opportunity to utilize whatever herbs you may be having in the house. This will give you the fresh taste required of a well-prepared salad.</li><li><strong>Do not fear the fat - </strong>Just like in restaurants, you shouldn’t be afraid to try adding some oil to the mix since fat equals flavor. This will make it taste better and more satiating. You can add this with the dressing or with ingredients like bacon, toasted nuts, cheese, or avocado.</li></ul><h2>Is eating salad everyday good for you?</h2><p class=align-left>Including salad in your diet almost every day may be among the most healthy and recommended eating habits adopted by many across the world.
