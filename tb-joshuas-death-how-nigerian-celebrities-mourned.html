You said you wanted them to know that laughter helps to heal the soul, just as a little red wine was good for the stomach.</p><p>@mcabbeydaprof and @lepaciousbose were the only ones who agreed to come. Even these two, had reservations. Just like when we went to entertain President Yaradua in Kastina, @lepaciousbose said, ‚ÄúBros if you will go, I will follow you.‚Äù</p><p>I remember during the performances, when my colleagues were done, and during my performance, I walked unto the Altar and picked an apple üçé and a bananaüçå‚Ä¶ the whole congregation went silent. You later told me that you watched all our performances from your office and cracked up at the look on the faces of the congregation.</p><p>When we (Abbey and Bose) each had our private meetings with you, you asked why I had not gone into church ministration. I replied that I didn‚Äôt think I want to fast or intercede for anyone. And I said I have not been a good boy.</p><p>You laughed and asked me, ‚ÄúAre badder than King David and Apostle Paul? Even if you are a killer God can use anyone.‚Äù You then started telling me, what only I knew about my life. Just as you were saying those things, I thought, this man may be fake, and you said, ‚ÄúYou may think I am fake, it‚Äôs ok. I can‚Äôt make you change your thinking. That is you‚Äù</p><p>I froze.</p><p>Then you prayed and gave me a ‚Äúthanks for coming‚Äù. I then said thank you. And thought ‚ÄúI would share it 3 ways‚Äù. You did that mind reading again. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs for you alone‚Äù.</p><p>You stopped at the door and went to a drawer to gift üéÅme a Fisher Electronic Bible. ‚ÄúAlways stay close to God and read his word every day. You have a destiny for God‚Äù In the last 8 years, you have consistently called to ‚ÄúMy brother, how are you? Draw nearer to God‚Äù. One time you asked, ‚ÄúWhat is holding you up from God‚Äôs work?‚Äù And after my covid experience you called to pray and sent something ‚Äúfor phensic‚Äù. I told you the ‚Äúphensic‚Äù made the prayer work faster. You laughed. You always joked that you were older than me by just 12 days, as I was born on June 24th‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49wZq2aXZ%2B8tLTUmqpmnJWWwal5x6iuZqaZnLKztcCnZJydnJqvs7XTopysZZ2kwrO6xJ1m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftb-joshuas-death-how-nigerian-celebrities-mourned.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftb-joshuas-death-how-nigerian-celebrities-mourned.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftb-joshuas-death-how-nigerian-celebrities-mourned.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftb-joshuas-death-how-nigerian-celebrities-mourned.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftb-joshuas-death-how-nigerian-celebrities-mourned.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftb-joshuas-death-how-nigerian-celebrities-mourned.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./when-was-below-deck-sailing-yacht-season-3-filmed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./when-was-below-deck-sailing-yacht-season-3-filmed.html>When Did the Parsifal III Crew Film 'Below Deck Sailing Yacht' Season 3?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-lagos-side-chic-drugged-and-stabbed-nigerian-billionaire-michael-usifo-ataga-to-death.html>How Lagos Side Chic Drugged And Stabbed Nigerian Billionaire, Michael Usifo Ataga To Death</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-lagos-side-chic-drugged-and-stabbed-nigerian-billionaire-michael-usifo-ataga-to-death.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
