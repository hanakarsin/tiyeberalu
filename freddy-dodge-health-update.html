The original series followed miners as they worked hard to discover "gold in them thar hills." In all seriousness, these miners go through a lot on the show to find the precious metal, and it makes sense that viewers became as enthralled with the men themselves as they were with their adventures in seeking out gold. One man audiences fell in love with is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Freddy Dodge</a>, who is a gold mining master.</p><p>Freddy's popularity was so immense that Discovery Channel gave him his own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold Rush spinoff</a>. Gold Rush Mine Rescue with Freddy and Juan follows Freddy and his partner in mining, <a href=#>Juan Ibarra</a>, as they travel and help other miners who are struggling with the operation of their mines. Both men have a lot of expertise, and viewers enjoyed seeing Freddy in a slightly different capacity. However, after the Season 3 premiere, his fans are concerned that his health is deteriorating after seeing how much weight he's lost.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Discovery</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Freddy's had a cancer scare in the past, and now 'Gold Rush' fans are concerned after seeing his drastic weight loss.</h2><p>Around 2018, the year Season 8 of Gold Rush aired, Freddy experienced a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cancer scare</a> that had viewers concerned. Luckily, after testing, he learned that the tumor that had developed was benign, and once they removed it, he was back to business as usual. In 2022, fans became concerned as Freddy had put on a lot of weight, which worried them about other potential health issues. One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan on Reddit</a> at the time said they were concerned that he'd have a heart attack. Now they're concerned that he's too thin.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Discovery</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Freddy Dodge has not made any official statement about his health, and he could have lost weight for any number of reasons.</h2><p>As of right now, Freddy has made no mention of anything being wrong with his health. In fact, his primary focus has been on getting viewers to watch the newest season of Gold Rush Mine Rescue with Freddy and Juan. Now in its third season, the series takes Freddy and Juan all over the country to help miners with their businesses with whatever they may need. The expertise of both Freddy and Juan is perfectly displayed in the series. Freddy asked his fans to tune in for the premiere on X.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Discovery</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans often overstep their bounds when it comes to making assumptions about their favorite stars' health and potential health issues.</h2><p>Fans can't help but <a href=#>comment on</a> weight gain and loss of stars. It has happened in devastating scenarios and is a constant when it comes to the fluctuating weight of countless female celebrities. Freddy's fans clearly have good intent in their concerns for his health, but it's not necessarily their place to make such assumptions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7%2BmsMOyZJ2nlJyybrTEmqOtoF2qvaWt054%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffreddy-dodge-health-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffreddy-dodge-health-update.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffreddy-dodge-health-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffreddy-dodge-health-update.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffreddy-dodge-health-update.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffreddy-dodge-health-update.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./immanuel-kant-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./immanuel-kant-html.html>Immanuel Kant - Trivia, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./queer-life-conversation.html>This Unexpected Exchange Is the Queer Story That Will Warm Your Heart Today</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./queer-life-conversation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
