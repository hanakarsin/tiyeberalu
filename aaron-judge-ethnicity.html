Although there is much controversy over who holds the record, Aaron officially became the fifth player in major league baseball history to hit 60 home runs in a single season on Sept. 20, 2022. Talk about making history!</p><p>There’s no denying the fact that he is incredibly talented in his sport of choice, but fans want to know more about his personal life. Here’s what curious fans should know about his ethnicity and his parents.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Aaron Judge’s ethnicity?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LiveRampUp</a>, Aaron is biracial. However, the site explains that since his biological parents are unknown, his exact ethnicity is also a mystery. (Aaron was adopted soon after his birth, per the site.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Aaron Judge hit his 62nd home run of the season on Oct. 4, 2022.</h2><p>Aaron Judge hit his 61st home run of the 2022 season during the team's game against the Toronto Blue Jays on Sept. 28, tying the late great Roger Maris's American League record.</p><p>Just days later, on Oct. 4, 2022, at Globe Life Field against the Texas Rangers, he broke the record with home run No. 62.</p><p>“I had a good feeling off the bat,” Aaron <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told MLB.com</a>. “I just didn’t know where it was going to land or what it was going to hit. There was a good sense of relief once I saw it in that fan’s glove.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by New York Yankees (@yankees)</a></p></figure><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MLB</a>, Aaron managed to get his 61st home run ball back and gave it to his mother, Patty.</p><p>"She’s been with me through it all," Aaron told the press. "From the Little League days, getting me ready for school, taking me to my first couple of practices and games, being there for my first professional game, my debut and now getting a chance to be here for this — this is something special, and we’re not done yet."</p><p>As for No. 62, that ball was caught by Corey Youmans, who happens to be the husband of former Bachelor contestant <a href=#>Bri Amaranthus</a>. He did not share what he planned to do with the ball when he caught it.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who are Aaron Judge's parents?</h2><p>Aaron was adopted by his parents, Patty and Wayne Judge, shortly after he was born. When Aaron reached his preteen years, he confronted his parents about why he didn’t look like them.</p><p>He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Post</a>, "I was about 10 or 11 and we really didn’t look alike, so I started asking questions. They told me I was adopted and answered all my questions, and that was that. I was fine with it. It really didn’t bother me because that’s the only parents I’ve known."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@thejudge44</a></figure><p>Aaron told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsday</a> that he doesn’t feel any desire to seek out his biological parents.</p><p>He said, “I have one set of parents, the ones that raised me. That’s how it is. Some kids grow in their mom's stomach; I grew in my mom‘s heart. She’s always shown me love and compassion ever since I was a little baby. I’ve never needed to think differently or wonder about anything."</p><p>Aaron's parents prioritized his education over his athletic career. It turns out that he probably could’ve gone pro as a baseball player way earlier on, but his parents pushed him to attend college first.</p><p>He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MLB,</a> "They wanted me to always make sure I put education first ... They’d say, 'Hey, you’ve got homework to do. You’ve got to finish your math homework and science homework. Then, if you have time left over for dinner, you can go play.' Something like that. I didn’t like it as a kid, but looking back on it, I really appreciate what they did for me."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Aaron went on to rave about his mother, saying, "I know I wouldn’t be a New York Yankee if it wasn’t for my mom. The guidance she gave me as a kid growing up, knowing the difference [between] right and wrong, how to treat people, and how to go the extra mile and put in extra work. All that kind of stuff. She’s molded me into the person that I am today."</p><p>It’s obvious that Aaron's tight-knit connection to his parents has helped him along the way with his baseball career.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Aaron Judge have any siblings?</h2><p>Aaron's parents, Patty and Wayne, also adopted his older brother, John, and raised them both in Linden, Calif. He seems to be very private, but according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, John worked as an English teacher in South Korea as recently as 2017.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Aaron Judge is a devout Christian on and off the baseball field.</h2><p>Regarding religion, Aaron Judge is a devout Christian and frequently posts about his faith on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>; his bio even reads, "Christian. Faith, Family, then Baseball."</p><p>In December 2019, Aaron attended an event for his nonprofit, All Rise Foundation, in Fresno, Calif. and discussed his favorite Bible verse: 2 Corinthians 5:7 — "For we walk by faith, not by sight."</p><p>"It’s one of my favorite Bible verses," Aaron said (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Spectrum</a>). "I try to live my life by it, and always trust the Man Above and what He’s got in store for us. We never know what’s around the corner, but if we have faith in Him, He will lead us in the right direction."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflq6zu81moa6cl5p6psDHp6CcoaSufA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faaron-judge-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2faaron-judge-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2faaron-judge-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2faaron-judge-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faaron-judge-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2faaron-judge-ethnicity.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./november2-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./november2-html.html>November 2 Horoscope and Zodiac</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-the-hiccup-effect-tiktok.html>What Is &amp;quot;Hiccup Effect&amp;quot; on TikTok?
