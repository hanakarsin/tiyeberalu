Because a majority of them are Nigerians, even though there are some foreigners among them.</p><p>“But Nigerians among them can be convinced, as the Niger Delta militants were convinced and empowered to stop.</p><p>“If that fails, then the government can use force on them wherever they are.”</p><p>The Acting Inspector-General of Police, IGP Olukayode Adeolu Egbetokun, has ordered the resuscitation of the Awards and Commendation system for the Nigeria Police Force, implemented under the guidance of his administration, to enhance motivation and encouragement among Police Officers.</p><p>This renewed commendation system represents a significant advancement from the past, as it now covers all officers involved in every major case, moving away from solely focusing on arresting officers or commanders.</p><p>According to a statement made available to Naija News on Sunday by the Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, the new system is in line with the provisions of Section 92 of the Police Act 2020, and Order 68 of the Force Orders and Instructions, and will be a milestone in recognizing the collective efforts of all officers in upholding law and order in the nation.</p><p>Traditionally, the Nigeria Police Force has a history of conferring commendations and rewards to specific officers who have displayed exemplary performances in critical operations. With the new system, commendations and awards will now be bestowed upon all officers who played a crucial role in resolving major cases, promoting a sense of camaraderie, unity, and teamwork within the force.</p><p>This development emphasizes the importance of collaboration and shared responsibility in achieving the force’s objectives.</p><p>Furthermore, the introduction of this new commendation and award system also marks a commitment to shelve unnecessary special promotions, which have hitherto been ridiculous in the NPF.</p><p>The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has explained the reason behind the delay in the payment of June 2023 monthly allowance to serving corps members.</p><p>The NYSC management in a statement on Sunday by the Director, Press and Public Relations, Eddy Megwa said the delay is due to the administration of funds by various banks who are yet to credit Corps Members’ accounts.</p><p>The NYSC management added that it is aware of and working with the banks to facilitate the payment of the monthly allowance to corps members.</p><p>In the meantime, it appealed for calm from the corps members, urging them to remain dutiful and law-abiding.</p><p>As lawmakers prepare to return from their Sallah break, signs suggest that President Bola Tinubu might send his ministerial nominees’ list to the National Assembly this week.</p><p>The 10th Senate and House of Representatives will resume their duties on July 4, following their recess.</p><p>It is expected that the ministerial list may be a top agenda item upon their return.</p><p>Since President Tinubu took office on May 29, there’s been considerable speculation and heated debates about who would make the cut for the ministerial positions.</p><p>The President has kept his choices under wraps, even from his closest allies.</p><p>There was a buzz last week that some All Progressives Congress (APC) governors might have the opportunity to nominate more than one person for the ministerial positions.</p><p>According to an anonymous source that spoke with Punch, the ministerial list could reach the Senate this week, with the new cabinet expected to be in place later this month.</p><p>President Bola Tinubu has been admonished to publish the details of what the N400 billion saved so far on the removal of fuel subsidy has been used for.</p><p>The call was made by the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) in a letter dated July 1, 2023, and signed by the group’s deputy director Kolawole Oluwadare, Naija News reports.</p><p>SERAP noted that it was vital for the Tinubu-led government to “urgently publish details of spending of about N400bn so far saved as a result of the removal of subsidy on Premium Motor Spirit popularly known as petrol.”</p><p>According to the rights group, Nigerians have the right to know what the savings was used for, adding that to “provide details of the plans on how subsequent savings from the removal of petroleum subsidy would be used, including specific projects on which the funds would be spent, and the mechanisms that have been put in place to ensure that any such savings are not embezzled, misappropriated, or diverted into private pockets.”</p><p>SERAP’s request follows reports that the Federal Government saved N400 billion in the four weeks after the implementation of the policy on the removal of petrol subsidy payments.</p><p>A member, of the governing board of the Center for Democracy and Development (CDD), Professor Jibrin Ibrahim has said the planned palliative by the federal government might end up like the situation with COVID-19.</p><p>According to him, the subsidy removal palliative might end up not serving its intended purpose just like in the case of the COVID-19 palliative during the pandemic.</p><p>Naija News reports that Ibrahim, while featuring on ARISE TV, said the fuel subsidy palliative can on its own become another subsidy regime on its own.</p><p>Some officers of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) have reported what they called the Force’s indiscriminate and unfair deductions from their salaries.</p><p>Naija News learnt that some officers of the police force have complained of extortion of millions of naira from their salaries for the former Inspector General of Police (IGP).</p><p>According to these officers, the deductions from their June salaries which ranged between N500 to N5000 were termed the IGP’s sports levy.</p><p>Some of the officers who spoke to SaharaReporters said the amount ranged from rank, and the money is a lot because of the population of officers involved.</p><p>In an internal signal by the police authorities, the officers were asked to sacrifice N500 to N5000 as IGP’s sports levy depending on the rank.</p><h2>Those are the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
