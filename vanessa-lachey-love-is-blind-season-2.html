Shortly thereafter, it was confirmed that the second season would focus on singletons in the Chicago area.&nbsp;</p><p>Vanessa exclusively confirmed to Distractify that she and Nick were preparing to leave sometime in April to begin filming the next two seasons back-to-back. After Chicago, the third season of the show will center in Dallas.&nbsp;</p><p>While some fans assumed that the pods would make it easy to film Love Is Blind in the throes of the pandemic, Vanessa shared that it was a lot more complicated than that.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>"People think that it's something that's easy to film during lockdown, but the pods are only part of the process," she explained. "The rest of it is those interactions after the pods â€” when they see the person at the romantic getaway, and then when they get back home. There's a lot of physical interaction, which is why it's been pushed so long."</p><p>It's unclear whether the romantic getaways will be like they were in Season 1 or if they'll be staycations due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>"We wanted to find a way to be safe, and they've finally found that way," the Call Me Kat actress shared, before adding that she's excited to film in order to give new content to viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>She's also looking forward to an upcoming award show.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The 'TRL' alum is hosting the Total Wireless Awards to celebrate people doing the extraordinary.</h2><p>The filming schedule for Love Is Blind is just one of countless things upended by the COVID-19 pandemic.
