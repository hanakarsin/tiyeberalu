The rumors have been posted and reacted to several times, which has led many to wonder exactly what happened to Xiao Xiao.</p><p>Xiao Xiao is a 36-year-old woman who first went viral after a video of her was posted on the Chinese social media site Doujin, which is considered the Chinese equivalent of TikTok. Now, many are hoping that the rumors about her and all the chatter happening online aren't true.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@coisasaleatoriasmundo</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to TikTok sensation Xiao Xiao?</h2><p>The rumors that Xiao Xiao has died have been picking up steam online thanks largely to a viral tweet. It isn't clear who's behind that tweet and whether the information is accurate. There's also no information about how Xiao Xiao may have allegedly died. So for now, users who loved her content are paying tribute to her, and hoping that the news they've heard is just another death hoax.</p><p>"I just heard that Xiao Xiao passed away please let this be a joke," one person wrote, with many others echoing their comments.</p><p>In a related development, Xiao Xiao's account on social media appear to have been suspended. It's possible that the removal of her accounts is what spawned the rumors that she had died, but the connection might not be that clear.</p><p>Users on Twitter are claiming that Xiao Xiao's accounts were suspended over allegations of child abuse. The allegations claim that Xiao Xiao's mother was exploiting her disability by posting videos to social media sometimes without her full consent or awareness. While plenty of people clearly love Xiao Xiao and her videos, it also seems like her mother may have chosen to exploit her daughter instead of taking care of her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just heard that xiao xiao passed away please let this be a joke ðŸ’”ðŸ’”ðŸ’”<br><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hKIdD1DQ2X</a></p>â€” Brandon B (@LifeOfBrn) <a href=#>December 20, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Xiao Xiao?</h2><p>Xiao Xiao's videos have become popular on TikTok after collaborating with fellow Chinese influencer Mei Niang Xin Xin. In one video, she playfully kicks Mei Niang Xin Xin after she refuses to give the microphone to Xiao Xiao. That video was viewed more than 20 million times, and helped Xiao Xiao become a star on TikTok.</p><p>Although many people love the videos, some have also expressed concern about her wellbeing, as many of the videos show Xiao Xiao's caretakers intentionally aggravating her so that they can see how she will react. They film those reactions and post them, often receiving millions of views in the process. Now, it seems like that may be the very reason that Xiao Xiao's account was taken down. Fans are certainly hoping that's all there is to this particular story.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnXopioZaierrB506Kiraeb</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-xiao-xiao-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-xiao-xiao-tiktok.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-xiao-xiao-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-xiao-xiao-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-xiao-xiao-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-xiao-xiao-tiktok.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1402966-john-m-cusimano-bio-rachael-rays-husband-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1402966-john-m-cusimano-bio-rachael-rays-husband-html.html>John Cusimano's bio: what is known about Rachael Ray's husband?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./280592-jamaa-afumaniwa-akimpiga-mabusu-mama-pima-html.html>Jamaa afumaniwa akimpiga mabusu mama pima</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./280592-jamaa-afumaniwa-akimpiga-mabusu-mama-pima-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
