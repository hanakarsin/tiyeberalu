This he said happened in 2010 or thereabout.</p><p>The former Alpha Beta boss said the aim of the move was to shield Tinubu’s involvement from public scrutiny and that Olumide Ogunmola was named the managing partner of the newly transformed company while he became deputy managing partner.</p><p>Apara said Tinubu asked Ogunmola to step aside in 2014, while he was named managing partner.</p><p>The claimant said as the head of the company, he began looking into its finances and he made many startling discoveries such as mysterious transfers of over N20bn in different currencies to several companies including payment of N1bn to Vintage Press, publishers of The Nation newspaper; and Lagoon Press Limited, publishers of National Life Newspaper.</p><p>Apara said he realised that all the payments were sanctioned by the partners nominated by Tinubu and they were done without his knowledge contrary to the terms of their partnership.</p><p>“N550million payment to Ocean Trust Ltd vide payment instruction dated the 15/5/18 (h) N850million payment to Ocean Trust Ltd vide payment instruction dated the 14/3/15; (i) N1 billion in Afkar printing Press together with Vintage Press Limited and Lagoon Press Limited in October 2017,” he said.</p><p>The former Alpha Beta boss said N960 million was spent on purchasing HITV’s 300,000,000 shares, adding that Tinubu was furious that he was looking into the company’s finances and ordered that he be demoted to deputy managing partner.</p><p>Apara said he refused to obey this order and this led to a feud between both of them. The feud, he said led to his forcefully removal from office while Tinubu’s former Commissioner for Finance, Doherty, was named the new head of the company.</p><p>The former Alpha Beta boss said since his illegal removal, he had been denied of his dividends as a founding partner of the company and asked the court to order full payment of his entitlements.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe49yZp%2BqkaqxbsDIp6ybrV2XvKK%2F056bZqulqL2musOem2adlpiwbq%2FHmqCrpZGjeq6txq5ksKelobFuvNGoq56bpGK1qrmO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffraud-tinubu-boasted-suspended-efcc-chairman-magu-would-protect-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffraud-tinubu-boasted-suspended-efcc-chairman-magu-would-protect-him.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffraud-tinubu-boasted-suspended-efcc-chairman-magu-would-protect-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffraud-tinubu-boasted-suspended-efcc-chairman-magu-would-protect-him.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffraud-tinubu-boasted-suspended-efcc-chairman-magu-would-protect-him.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffraud-tinubu-boasted-suspended-efcc-chairman-magu-would-protect-him.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./59925-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./59925-html.html>Abia State Governor Theodore Orjo Says No Igbo presidential candidate in 2015</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./where-was-as-luck-would-have-it-filmed.html>Where Was 'As Luck Would Have It' Filmed?
