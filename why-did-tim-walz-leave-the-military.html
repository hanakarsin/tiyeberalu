Specifically, it has to do with the timing of when he left, the way in which his rank changed, and even a comment he later made about his experience in the military.</p><p>Kamala Harris's VP running mate also faces criticism from Donald Trump's VP running mate <a href=#>J.D. Vance</a> about "<a href=#>stolen valor</a>."</p><p>So what's going on, exactly?

The men who served with Tim Walz describe his service as Traitorous, fraudulent, and shameful.

However, because he didn't finish all of his training requirements, he instead retired as a master sergeant (a reduced rank) for benefits purposes, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Military.com</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He knew exactly what he was doing representing himself in any way shape or form as a “Command Sergeant Major” or “Sergeant Major, Retired”</p><p>This is blatant Stolen Valor by <a href=#>@GovTimWalz</a></p>— Andrew "Drew" Mullins (@realDrewMullins) <a href=#>August 6, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did J.D. Vance accuse Tim Walz of "stolen valor"?</h2><p>In August 2024, Vance told rally-goers at a campaign event in Michigan that "what bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you’re not."</p><p>In this case, Vance was referring to a comment that Walz — who never saw combat during his service — made in 2018 after the <a href=#>Parkland high school shooting</a>, in which Walz said, "We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Because of these comments, Vance — who served four years in the Marines (including six months in Iraq) but also never saw combat — accused Walz of using "stolen valor."</p><p>However, Walz responded with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>, explaining that "in his 24 years of service, the governor carried, fired, and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2asmaJ6uK3Ls2SlnZGrsm7Ax55kpqGcnsGivtg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-tim-walz-leave-the-military.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-tim-walz-leave-the-military.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-tim-walz-leave-the-military.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-tim-walz-leave-the-military.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-tim-walz-leave-the-military.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-tim-walz-leave-the-military.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1349037-100-ridiculous-bear-puns-and-jokes-that-might-be-polar-izing-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1349037-100-ridiculous-bear-puns-and-jokes-that-might-be-polar-izing-html.html>100+ ridiculous bear puns and jokes that might be polar-izing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jessica-mulroney-html.html>Jessica Mulroney - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jessica-mulroney-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
