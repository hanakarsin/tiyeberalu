The actor, who has been in everything from Little Women to Dune, has become a new kind of Hollywood heartthrob, and thus far, he has also been a pretty solid role model.</p><p>Recently, though, rumors began to swirl online that Timothée had been arrested. Now, many want to know whether those rumors are true, and what Timothée could have been arrested for.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Was Timothée Chalamet arrested?</h2><p>There has been no reporting suggesting that Timothée Chalamet was arrested. A photo of the actor that purports to be a mugshot has been circulating online, but that mugshot is actually just a photoshopped image of the actor that makes it seem like he's been arrested. For now, then, it seems like Timothée's squeaky-clean reputation will remain relatively intact, even as it's been complicated slightly by his dating life.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Timothée has been dating Kylie Jenner in recent months.</h2><p>Even as his profile has continued to grow as he takes on bigger and bigger projects, Timothée has worked hard to ensure that his private life remains exactly that. All that changed recently after the news first broke that Timothée was dating Kylie Jenner, one of the most famous women on the planet. Although it was hard to know whether the rumor was true, at least for a time, that all changed when the two of them were spotted together at a Beyonce concert.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ,</a> Timothée discussed his desire for privacy, explaining that he understood the contradictions inherent in that desire, given the life he's chosen. The GQ writer even prodded him, pointing out that someone who really wanted privacy might not be traveling around with one of the most followed people on Instagram.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"This reminds me of that recent South Park episode with the Worldwide Privacy Tour," the actor said in response, referring to an episode about Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's publicity tour, which seemed to be all about their desire for privacy<strong></strong>. "Sometimes, people are going to be hella confused when you say you're trying to live a private life."</p><p>Kylie has yet to address their relationship publicly, but it seems like it might be just a matter of time before she does.</p><p>In spite of all the attention that's been paid to Timothée's relationship status, it seems clear the actor does want at least some privacy in his life. It's a delicate balancing act for any celebrity. Even if he is never arrested, a backlash could be coming for him anyway if he finds himself too overexposed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK60edOipKismJqybq%2FHmqOapZWpeqK%2B0Z6qrZ2U</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwas-timothee-chalamet-arrested.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwas-timothee-chalamet-arrested.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwas-timothee-chalamet-arrested.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwas-timothee-chalamet-arrested.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwas-timothee-chalamet-arrested.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwas-timothee-chalamet-arrested.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./state-governors-are-absolutely-shameless-seyi-law-defends-tinubu-over-economic-hardship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./state-governors-are-absolutely-shameless-seyi-law-defends-tinubu-over-economic-hardship.html>'State Governors Are Absolutely Shameless'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./when-was-90-day-the-single-life-tell-all-filmed.html>The Single Life's Tell-All Filmed?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./when-was-90-day-the-single-life-tell-all-filmed.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
