When it comes to the world of politics, it's simplified between "liberal" and "conservative" mindsets. While there are minor squabbles and "cancellations" between these two groups, generally, people take a reductionist approach to online arguments and either go the GOP or DNC route. Or <a href=#>"cancel culture" vs. "political correctness,"</a> which is what's happening with this amen and awoman prayer.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Yes, you read that right, someone said, "awoman" after "amen" in a prayer.</h2><p>Emanuel Cleaver, while saying a prayer before the 117th meeting of Congress, ended his speech by saying "awoman" after "amen." Many took that as an attempt on Cleaver's behalf to be unnecessarily "politically correct." Pretty soon, the thread devolved into a general discussion about the pitfalls of identity politics, with many folks arguing that a long-running "liberal strategy" in securing DNC support was to focus on identity issues over policies.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>A prayer opening the 117th Congress concluded, "Amen and a woman."</p><p>"Amen" translates to "so be it." <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SIGBtgLk5v</a></p>‚Äî Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) <a href=#>January 4, 2021</a></figure><p>But for the most part, people wanted to point out that "awoman" is not only an entirely, newly fabricated word, but within the context of a prayer, it makes zero sense.</p><p>The definition of "amen" roughly translates to "so be it." It's an affirmation at the end of a prayer that's been used in a variety of different religions and cultural traditions for thousands of years.</p><p>Friar Matthew Schneider tweeted about the origin of "amen" as well: "For the record, <strong>AMEN</strong> comes from the Hebrew root ◊ê◊û◊ü ('MN) which is the verb to be firm, confirmed, reliable, faithful, have faith, believe. &nbsp;1. It has nothing to do with the word 'men.' 2. Most verb roots are 3 consonants in Hebrew, the first here is a silent consonant though."</p><p>He pointed out that the word has nothing to do with gender, along with some context surrounding its Hebraic roots.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>For the record, AMEN comes from the Hebrew root ◊ê◊û◊ü ('MN) which is the verb to be firm, confirmed, reliable, faithful, have faith, believe.</p><p>1.
