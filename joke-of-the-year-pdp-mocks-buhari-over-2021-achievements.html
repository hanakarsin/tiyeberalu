Today, our nation has become the poverty capital of the world due to the mismanagement, corruption and recklessness of the APC government.</p><p>“In 2015, Nigeria’s external debt was $7.3 billion. Today under the clueless APC government, in just over six years, the external debt has reached over $38 billion and counting, with no corresponding investment in the economy or infrastructure.</p><p>“Today, the poverty rate in Nigeria is 71 percent as against 32 percent when the APC government took over in 2015. Between January and September 2021, over $1.8 billion dollar was expended on debt services, yet the APC government can shamelessly claim to have performed in 2021.</p><p>“It is self-evident that only the APC gangsters can claim to have performed in the face of life discounting experiences of the ordinary Nigerians. Thankfully Nigerians now know them for who they are.</p><p>“Furthermore, it is ludicrous that the APC government claimed to be fighting corruption when it has become the haven of compromised and corrupt politicians. Evidently, that is why it has no answer to reports of how APC leaders and their cronies stole over N25 trillion from various government agencies. It also explains why the APC government has failed to prosecute its officials and APC leaders openly indicted for corruption.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5JqZqOnm5p6sLKMrZ%2BeZamarrN5z52nZqWfmLi0ecGun5qqmWK8t7HRZmlpamFirqS0yJ6tnqWVo8G0ew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoke-of-the-year-pdp-mocks-buhari-over-2021-achievements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjoke-of-the-year-pdp-mocks-buhari-over-2021-achievements.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjoke-of-the-year-pdp-mocks-buhari-over-2021-achievements.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjoke-of-the-year-pdp-mocks-buhari-over-2021-achievements.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoke-of-the-year-pdp-mocks-buhari-over-2021-achievements.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoke-of-the-year-pdp-mocks-buhari-over-2021-achievements.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-cnn-erroneously-referred-to-kashim-shettima-as-apc-presidential-candidate.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-cnn-erroneously-referred-to-kashim-shettima-as-apc-presidential-candidate.html>How CNN Erroneously Referred To Kashim Shettima As APC Presidential Candidate</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./you-will-die-nobody-will-pity-you-wike-sends-warning-to-kidnappers-informants-in-fct.html>You Will Die, Nobody Will Pity You Wike Sends Warning To Kidnappers, Informants In FCT</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./you-will-die-nobody-will-pity-you-wike-sends-warning-to-kidnappers-informants-in-fct.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
