Papa's death has left his extended family devastated and fans astounded by the sudden turn of events that has robbed one of the most renowned entertainers in Kenya.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/f74d36a44b5e343d.jpeg><p class=align-left>Charles Bukeko was Kenya's entertainment industry big-wig, having been there for a long time and experienced so much. His screen antics were loved by many, young and old alike, and behind the scenes, his influence was massive, paving the way for many big stars. That is why his sudden death appalled Kenyans; many people left upset by the unfortunate event.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/a67711b6a19526fd.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenya Power Celebrates Auto Electrician Mechanic Zipporah Mulati, Who Gave Birth to All Her Kids via C-Section</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Indeed, it has been an extremely difficult ordeal for family, friends, and fans.
