Morgan revealed that not only is her baby daddy a deadbeat, he also cheated on her through the course of the relationship and is a father to six other children.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In fact, he has another child only weeks older than Gianna. Yes, you read that correctly.</p><p>While most folks use social media to put people who did them wrong on blast, Morgan took the high road. She only refers to her baby daddy as “that random man in Atlanta.” However, the random man in Atlanta has now put a face to the drama, and folks are ripping him apart online. Here’s the full scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Morgan Bailey shared on TikTok that her baby daddy has been harassing her ever since her story blew up online.</h2><p>Be very careful of who you choose to procreate with. In an Aug. 13, 2023 TikTok reply video, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morgan Bailey (@morganbailey)</a> responded to a follower who joked about Morgan’s merchandise.</p><p>“The random kid from Atlanta gets me everytime,” one user commented.</p><p>Morgan then shared in the video that her baby daddy is mad about her exposure, merchandise, and being called out on social media for being a true f-boy.</p><p>“You guys got that random in Atlanta real mad at me today,” Morgan said while holding Gianna. “Real mad at me. He just told me to jump off of a cliff.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>“Like, which one sir? Which one?” Morgan asked. “That’s a little bit awkward. Anyways, go buy my merchandise. He’s upset that I made merchandise that says, ‘From a random man in Atlanta.’"</p><p>Morgan shared that it has been six months since the random man left her with their child, his T-shirt presses, and nothing else.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“So I made merchandise out of it using his T-shirt presses and he told me to jump off of a cliff.

Unfortunately, he shared in countless videos just how messed up he was toward Morgan, made accusations about her parents calling her a liar, and excuses about Morgan being wrong.</p><p>Keep in mind, based on words out of his own mouth, it’s clear as day that he mistreated Morgan and left her high and dry. Making matters worse, he left Morgan when she was 30 days postpartum after having a C-section and returned to Atlanta to live with his ex-girlfriend based on his mother’s advice, per Morgan. SMH!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In fact, it appears that Morgan’s account has become even more valid since another one of JaQuan’s baby mamas has stepped forward to tell her story.</p><p>Thanks to the TikTok account <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TeaTock (@clockntea)</a>, a woman named Allison Martorell also came forward to support Morgan’s claims in a shared video on their page.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“So that random man in Atlanta is also my baby daddy, too. I am baby mam No. 2,” Allison said in the video. And I’m here to say that everything Morgan is saying is true. Just as how she was pregnant with their daughter and he had someone else pregnant, similar situation with me.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“So, my son has a brother that is eight days older than him, and he doesn’t call, he hasn't called, helped with anything and he never has,” Allison said.</p><p>Not to mention, TikTok users have accused JaQuan of being a predator since he first met Morgan when she was 21 and he was 30.</p><p>That said, given JaQuan’s history for creating broken homes, many TikTok users are perplexed as to why he would reveal his identity to the world. As such, folks have not let up on JaQuan and have been calling him everything but a child of God.</p><p>Thankfully, Morgan has been able to to turn lemons into lemonade and is now in a better place mentally and financially to take care of herself and Gianna. Hopefully JaQuan's six other baby mamas can do the same.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyzs8CnZJuZmaGyunnToqKtp5tir6Ku2GabmpyUrg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmorgan-bailey-tiktok-baby-daddy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmorgan-bailey-tiktok-baby-daddy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmorgan-bailey-tiktok-baby-daddy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmorgan-bailey-tiktok-baby-daddy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmorgan-bailey-tiktok-baby-daddy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmorgan-bailey-tiktok-baby-daddy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-is-ksk-jack-ryan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-is-ksk-jack-ryan.html>What Is KSK in 'Jack Ryan' Season 2?
