Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Life</a>, a source recently revealed that Saweetie and Quavo are spending time together again after their March 2021 breakup.</p><p>‚ÄúSaweetie and Quavo are currently both in New York and have quietly been spending time together on the DL,‚Äù a music insider told the outlet. ‚ÄúQuavo has missed Saweetie since they broke up and he‚Äôs been asking to see her. Apparently, she gave in because they linked up in N.Y. and have hung out since they‚Äôre both there at the same time.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>quavo going back??? more like saweetie giving his sorry ass another chance and for what? ü§® <a href=#>https://t.co/Uhkusvrdr4</a></p>‚Äî Êµ∑Ë≥äÁéãüêâ (@satanslut666_) <a href=#>August 25, 2021</a></figure><p>The source also made it very clear that Saweetie and Quavo are not back together. That being said, the music insider shared that fans shouldn't be surprised if they hear that the pair are giving their relationship another shot.</p><p>‚ÄúNothing is official as of the moment, but don‚Äôt be surprised if you hear they‚Äôve reconciled," the source said.</p><p>However, Saweetie shared that the rumors are simply not true. After the news set social media ablaze, the star quickly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cleared things up on her Twitter page</a> on Aug. 26, 2021.</p><p>"Pinocchio a-s article ... anyways back to this #saweetiemeal," the beauty wrote with the Pinocchio face emoji.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom)</a></p></figure><p>Fans took that to mean that Saweetie is standing firm on her decision to leave the relationship. Social media users praised the star for quickly putting the rumors to rest and not going back to a toxic situation.</p><p>"She would be a fool if she did after the way he dogged her. Don't let him get near that McDonald's money!" one fan commented.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Saweetie officially announced that she was single in March 2021.</h2><p>On March 19, 2021, Saweetie took to Twitter to announce that she was officially single.</p><p>"I‚Äôm single. I‚Äôve endured too much betrayal and hurt behind the scenes for a false narrative to be circulating that degrades my character," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saweetie wrote</a>. "Presents don‚Äôt band-aid scars and the love isn‚Äôt real when the intimacy is given to other women."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I emotionally checked out a long time ago and have walked away with a deep sense of peace and freedom. Excited for this new chapter of elevation," she followed up in an additional tweet.</p><p>In response, Quavo tweeted out, "I had love for you and disappointed you did all that. You are not the woman I thought you were. I wish you nothing but the best." Saweetie retweeted the message, adding the words, "Take care."</p><p>Saweetie's initial tweet seemed to hint that some <a href=#>cheating had occurred</a> in their relationship, something that was previously speculated by fans following <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comedian Gerald Huston's comment</a> during the Gucci Mane and Jeezy Verzuz battle suggesting that Quavo had been intimate with Reginae Carter, Lil Wayne's daughter.</p><p>Rumors around Quavo and Saweetie's potential breakup initially spread when fans noticed that the couple unfollowed each other on Instagram after a clip of Saweetie‚Äôs interview on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Respectfully Justin</a> went viral.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Joined by hosts Justin Laboy and Justin Combs, Saweetie was given a hypothetical scenario that raised a lot of eyebrows on social media. In the final moments of the show, Saweetie was asked the circumstances under which she would grant her man a threesome, and her response had the hosts in shambles.</p><p>She answered, ‚ÄúSo, a threesome, right? I normally talk to men who are cultured, who have been around the world, who know a lot of people, and because he doin‚Äô everything right, I‚Äôm gonna give him the honor of pickin‚Äô the [n-word] we havin‚Äô a threesome with.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Saweetie‚Äôs additional mention of hating liars and getting her heart broken made many wonder if the celebrity couple was still going strong at the time. And according to Saweetie, there was definitely more behind the scenes than fans were privy to.</p><p>Despite the drama, it appears that Saweetie has no plans of reconciling with Quavo. After everything the star has endured throughout their relationship, fans believe it's best for Saweetie to count her losses and move on with her life.</p><p>We wish Saweetie all the best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledCumK%2BnXZa7pXnSmq6enaSesm6u0Z6YpGWlpQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-quavo-and-saweetie-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-quavo-and-saweetie-break-up.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-quavo-and-saweetie-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-quavo-and-saweetie-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-quavo-and-saweetie-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-quavo-and-saweetie-break-up.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./queer-life-conversation.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./queer-life-conversation.html>This Unexpected Exchange Is the Queer Story That Will Warm Your Heart Today</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./december1-html.html>December 1 Birthdays By Profession</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./december1-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
