The party argued that the period of Obi’s defection for the purpose of contesting the presidential election violated sections 77(2) and (3) of the Electoral Act, 2022.</p><p>“They also adduced that before Obi’s defection, the LP already sent a list of its registered members to the INEC. They then claimed that Obi lacked the right to be recognised as the LP flagbearer because his name was not on the list of the party members that were submitted to INEC.</p><p>“APM had urged the court to set aside the Federal High Court judgment which dismissed the suit it filed to challenge Obi’s candidacy on the same matter.</p><p>“But in a unanimous decision by the three-member panel of Justices, the appellate court said there was no merit in the appeal filed by APM.</p><p>“The Justices affirmed the decision of the Abuja High Court that had earlier dismissed the case saying that ‘the lower Court cannot be faulted, the appeal is devoid of merit, the same fails and it is deserving of dismissal.’</p><p>“Obi-Datti Media office wishes therefore to draw the attention of the public to this case and disregard the empty evidence and propaganda of the APC and its candidate in the highly contentious February 25 Presidential election.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49uZqmdpJq%2FbrvBoqpmm5GivW6%2BxJqaratdlsBuwMinrJutXamyrbjSZquroZKqu6K4jKGcZqGjYruwwIyaZK%2BZnJ6xbrnEppmeql2ks27Ax55kpZmSpMKzec%2Baqa2xXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpeter-obis-camp-reacts-as-tinubu-tells-tribunal-he-is-not-a-valid-member-of-the-labour-party.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpeter-obis-camp-reacts-as-tinubu-tells-tribunal-he-is-not-a-valid-member-of-the-labour-party.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpeter-obis-camp-reacts-as-tinubu-tells-tribunal-he-is-not-a-valid-member-of-the-labour-party.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpeter-obis-camp-reacts-as-tinubu-tells-tribunal-he-is-not-a-valid-member-of-the-labour-party.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpeter-obis-camp-reacts-as-tinubu-tells-tribunal-he-is-not-a-valid-member-of-the-labour-party.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpeter-obis-camp-reacts-as-tinubu-tells-tribunal-he-is-not-a-valid-member-of-the-labour-party.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./price-of-refilling-cooking-gas-per-kg-in-nigeria.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./price-of-refilling-cooking-gas-per-kg-in-nigeria.html>Price Of Refilling Cooking Gas Per Kg In Nigeria</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lily-collins-html.html>Lily Collins - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lily-collins-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
