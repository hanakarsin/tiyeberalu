From his rise to stardom with The Hunger Games to the more recent The Beekeeper, there's no denying that he has a certain charming charisma about him.</p><p>So, naturally, we need to know if he's single... and we need to know a detailed relationship history to find out who the lucky girls who won his love in the past are.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Victoria Justice</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>During their teenage years, and when Josh was still just a budding star, he and Victoria Justice started dating. It didn't come as too much of a surprise considering they were already friends for years.</p><p>In terms of young love, theirs seemed to last a decent amount of time. They were together for about a year and were seen on red carpets together. Neither has really revealed much about what went down to cause the end of their relationship.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Lanchen Mihalic</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Josh and Lanchen Mihalic linked some time between 2005 and 2009. Their relationship was sporadic from a public point of view. While we were aware they were dating, it was pretty much kept on the down low.</p><p>The pair were photographed together on occasion, but at some point it must have crumbled as Josh was suddenly single again. However, it's not clear when exactly this split happened.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Vanessa Hudgens</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>One of Josh's more serious public relationships was with Vanessa Hudgens. After meeting on the set of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, they started to get closer.</p><p>Vanessa brough Josh along to Coachella, which fans will recall was basically her kingdom as she was known as an annual fixture at the event. Again, due to Josh's private nature, details on the relationship are a bit sparse.</p><p>Once they split, they still had to do a press tour together to promote the movie. It appeared to be an amicable break, but they did have to deal with an awkward moment where they were asked about their relationship, causing them to admit that it was actually already over.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Claudia Traisac</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Claudia Traisac and Josh are a total adorable it-couple. Their long-term relationship started in 2013, but he initially kept it private. It wasn't until 2015 that he really gave the public some details and even those were pretty minor.</p><p>The pair met on the set of Paradise Lost, so when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour </a>asked Josh his opinion on dating co-stars, he honestly replied: "As far as I'm concerned, you're both actors, you understand each other's lifestyle, so it's a very natural thing to have happen."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Did Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence ever date?</h2><p>Despite their total on-screen chemistry, Josh and Jennifer Lawrence never actually dated. It turns out that Peeta and Katniss's relationship was just super good acting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"It never got confusing or blurred or weird or anything like that. Genuinely, for me, that was so much better than having had some romantic thing. I'll tell you why, because now she's a friend of mine and there's nothing that has tainted that friendship," he told Dax Shepard on his Armchair Expert podcast.</p><p>That being said, Jennifer did admit that we weren't all crazy and that chemistry did have some sort of merit. “We’re great together,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> in an interview. “We can really kiss.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7y0tIyhrK2bmJq%2FtLvNZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWYnsC1u9Gy</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjosh-hutcherson-relationship-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjosh-hutcherson-relationship-history.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjosh-hutcherson-relationship-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjosh-hutcherson-relationship-history.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjosh-hutcherson-relationship-history.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjosh-hutcherson-relationship-history.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2tnslppbntso-tiktok-explained.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2tnslppbntso-tiktok-explained.html>What Does 2TNSLPPBNTSO&amp;quot; Mean?
