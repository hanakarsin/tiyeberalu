While Jim's blue eyes give away that he isn't a traditional Hebrew man, Jim does consider himself a devout Catholic. Additionally, Jim points to Pope John Paul II as his most significant influence.</p><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>, Jim shared about playing Jesus Christ in The Passion of Christ. He said, "All of a sudden, I wasn’t popular anymore, and not because I did anything wrong. I mean, I just played Jesus. So, did this rejection affect me personally? Well, we all have our own cross to bear. But hey, in the end, none of us will live in this world forever. Not even those Hollywood producers. At some point, everyone has to answer for what they’ve done in their lives."</p><p>In 2023, Jim also starred in Sound of Freedom, a movie based on a true story that shows retired federal agents working to save children from human trafficking. During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a> that Jim did while promoting Sound of Freedom, he talked about his thoughts on modern-day Christianity and his purpose in acting.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Jim shared, "The problem is that modern day Christianity has become so weak and useless. I mean, modern day Christians are more afraid of the devil than they are of God. God could destroy the devil without a glance, but he looks to us to make a decision."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Jim credits God for his acting career.</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TBN</a>, Jim shared that God found him in a movie theater and made him feel loved and at peace. During this movie theater experience, Jim explained that he heard God tell him to become an actor. He shared about how he wanted to create movies in Hollywood that focused on faith.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Some of the best Hollywood stars are Catholics.</p><p>Mark Wahlberg<br>Jim Caviezal<br>Eduardo Verástegui<br>Mel Gibson<br>Neal McDonough<br>and the latest addition Shia LaBeouf. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/FybE4I9ZRQ</a></p>— Sachin Jose (@Sachinettiyil) <a href=#>January 4, 2024</a></figure><p>Jim said, "I wanted to make movies that had a redeemable quality. That’s why I was called into this business. I gave my career to Jesus." But, his acting career isn't the only way Jim chooses to represent Christ. In his most recent event, Jim is speaking at the Celebrating Life luncheon, which will be hosted at the Waco Convention Center in Texas.</p><p>Every chance he gets in interviews and in his work, Jim never misses an opportunity to talk about his belief in Jesus Christ. He also shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>, "The purpose God gave me in this business, I wanted to bring his light," he explained. "And it doesn't mean I'm always his light into an industry. And I wanted to do that, but it doesn't mean that I'm not going to play the devil in movies. Just there's got to be some sort of moral redemption."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7auecKaraKdqpq5br7EpaCgoZ%2Bj</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjim-caviezel-religion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjim-caviezel-religion.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjim-caviezel-religion.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjim-caviezel-religion.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjim-caviezel-religion.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjim-caviezel-religion.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./benue-miyetti-allah-herdsmen-attacking-ortom.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./benue-miyetti-allah-herdsmen-attacking-ortom.html>Miyetti Allah Speaks On Herdsmen Attacking Ortom</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./davis-cleveland-html.html>Davis Cleveland - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./davis-cleveland-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
