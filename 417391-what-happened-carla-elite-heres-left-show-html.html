The viewers establish close connections with their favourite cast members season after season. With her recent exit from the series, netizens have been wondering, what happened to Carla in Elite?</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/a3d1bf26df97e45f.jpeg><p class=align-left>The removal of a lead character from a film or series frequently raises eyebrows, with viewers struggling to understand the reason behind such a move. Despite the producers having valid explanations for such actions, the viewers are almost always left speculating. So, what happened to Carla in Elite?</p><h2>What is Elite?</h2><p class=align-left><i>Elite</i> is a Spanish teen drama that airs on <a href=#>Netflix</a>. The series follows a group of students at Las Encinas, a reputable private school. The storyline delves deep into their complicated personal lives involving love, sexuality, abuse, social class, and other teenage anxieties.</p><p class=align-left>The dramatic events are all set against a background of murder incidents that have rocked the school community. Since its premiere in 2018, it has attracted a loyal, worldwide fanbase and is currently in its fourth season. The students go through school and graduate, forcing some to exit the show for good.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/949671f7b71d8c9b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Will there be a Clarice Season 2?

''Why is Carla called Marchioness?'' The actress is the daughter of a member of the Spanish nobility who is the heiress of the Marquesado de Caleruega, which means Marchioness in Spanish.</p><p class=align-left>Carla's mom posseses a vineyard that bears the same name, meaning Carla is the future heiress, hence the nickname. Carla often uses her sexuality to get her way around what she wants.</p><p class=align-left>Carla was famed for being in a love triangle with Polo, her lover since they were 12 years old and Christian. But, in a strange twist, she later found herself caught between Christian and Samuel. She was a fan favourite because of her <a href=#>beauty</a>, intelligence, and character.</p><h2>What happened to Carla from Elite?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/949671f7b71d8c9b.jpeg><p class=align-left>Is Carla in Season 4 of <i>Elite</i>?
